"""Keep the brief inside its length, deterministically.

The pipeline had a floor and no ceiling. When the target rose to 2,000 words
the model filled the section caps instead, and those caps permitted about
3,680 words between them, so an issue shipped at 3,518. A reader who was
promised an eight-minute read got fifteen.

Asking the model to be shorter is not a ceiling. It is a preference that
competes with every other instruction in the prompt, and on a heavy news day
it loses. This module is the ceiling: if the brief is over budget after the
model has written it, sections are trimmed from the tail in a fixed order
until it fits.

The order is an editorial judgement, stated once here rather than improvised.
Top stories and the morning memo are never trimmed — they are the brief. What
goes first is breadth that repeats value found elsewhere: the tail of The
Wire, then quoted statements, then the second and third op-ed. Trimming takes
from the end of each section because the model is asked to order by
importance within a section, so the tail is the least important item it chose.

Nothing here rewrites text. It only drops whole items, so anything that
survives is exactly what the model wrote and every remaining claim keeps the
source it was checked against.
